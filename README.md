- Math Calc for the solar pannel output:
    E = A * r * H * PR

- E = energy (kWh)
- A = Total solar pannel area (m2)
- r = Solar yield / efficiency (%)
- H = Annual average solar radiation / we'll use GHI (Global Horizontal Irradiance) returned in kwH/m2/year - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_irradiance
- PR = Performance ratio (Between 0.5 - 0.9, we'll use 0.75)
