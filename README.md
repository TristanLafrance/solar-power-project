This is my final project from my bootcamp !

The delay for this project was 2 weeks. 95% of the work was done it this time frame to meet the MVP, the rest was some CSS edit & adding comments.

The goal of this project was to create from scratch, a working front-end & back-end website, using:

- React
- Node.JS & Express.JS
- MongoDB


In this project, we answer two main questions:

1- How much electricity/money does your solar pannel produce ?

2- How much time to payback your solar pannel ?

What data & calculation did I use ? Let's take a look. 

For the first question witch is "How much electricity/money does your solar pannel produce ?" we need 4 variables.
